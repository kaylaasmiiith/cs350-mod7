Project Summary
The project involved developing a smart thermostat prototype using the TI CC3220x LaunchPad. The primary goal was to create a functional thermostat that could read room temperature using the TMP006 sensor via I2C, control an LED to indicate heating status, and allow users to adjust the set temperature with two buttons. Additionally, the prototype simulated data transmission to a server using UART. This project addressed the need for an accessible, energy-efficient thermostat solution that can be connected to cloud services for enhanced monitoring and control.

What I Did Particularly Well
I excelled in writing the interface software to control the hardware components, ensuring smooth communication between the temperature sensor and the microcontroller. The use of interrupts for button presses enhanced the responsiveness of the user interface. Additionally, I implemented a clear task scheduler that organized the various functionalities, making the code efficient and modular.

Where I Could Improve
One area for improvement would be in the documentation of the code. While I have comments explaining the major components, more detailed explanations of the logic behind certain decisions would enhance clarity for future developers. Additionally, I could explore implementing more advanced features, such as integrating additional sensors or refining the cloud connectivity for real-time data updates.

Tools and Resources Added to My Support Network
Throughout this project, I leveraged TI Code Composer Studio for development and testing. I also utilized online forums and documentation related to the TI CC3220x microcontroller and embedded systems, which provided invaluable insights. I plan to keep these resources accessible for future projects, along with joining relevant communities to stay updated on best practices.

Transferable Skills
The skills I developed during this project, such as interfacing hardware components, working with real-time systems, and using interrupts, are highly transferable to other projects in embedded systems and software development. Additionally, my experience with I2C communication and UART will be beneficial in any future projects requiring data transmission between devices.

Making the Project Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable
To ensure maintainability, I followed best coding practices, including modular design and thorough commenting. I structured the code in a way that separates different functionalities, which allows for easier updates and debugging. Furthermore, I used version control through GitHub to keep track of changes and facilitate collaboration, making it easier to adapt the project for future enhancements.
